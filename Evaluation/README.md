# Evaluation
This directory contains the raw survey responses and the computed results reported in the Evaluation section of the article.

## Directory Structure
 * [data](../Evaluation/data) *contains the exported survey responses for each individual participant.*
 * [results_threshold0](../Evaluation/results_threshold0) *contains the results calculated for Threshold-0 for each individual participant.*
 * [results_threshold1](../Evaluation/results_threshold1) *contains the results calculated for Threshold-1 for each individual participant.*

## Naming Convention
In the evaluation material, the survey responses (and the corresponding result files) are enumerated according to the following convention:

* R`n`\_`m`\_*.xlsx
* R`n`\_RE\_`m`\_*.xlsx

where `n` is the unique ID of the participant and `m` is a unique survey ID in LimeSurvey. File names containing the keyword `RE` reprsent the semantic profiles populated from the rhetorical zones of the authors' articles.
