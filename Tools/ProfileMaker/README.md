# ProfileMaker Tool Manual
ProfileMaker is a commandline tool written in Java to generate a human-readable version of semantic scholarly profiles.

ProfileMaker accepts a [TDB](https://jena.apache.org/documentation/tdb/)-based dataset of user profiles and generates one of the following output formats:

1. A LaTeX document that represents the profile in a tabular format.
2. A [LimeSurvey](https://www.limesurvey.org) input file that can be directly imported into a LimeSurvey installation.
